    <p>The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.</p>

    <p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.</p>

    <p>Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.</p>

    <p>A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion.
Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.</p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
    
    <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.</p>

    <p>Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mix together equal quantities of lighter mascarpone and ready-made custard and chill.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Halve and stone some nectarines or peaches. Very lightly brush with sunflower oil and barbecue for 4-8 minutes until nicely marked and heated through. Allow to cool a little then cut into bite-sized pieces.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Cut madeira cake into thick slices and barbecue for about 2 minutes until marked on each side. Allow to cool a little, and then cut into cubes.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Put the cubes of cake in the base of glasses. Sprinkle over a little fruit juice, orange liqueur or sweet wine – about 1 tbsp per glass. Top with the fruit, and then cover with the custard mixture.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Swap the stone fruit for pineapple and cut into 1cm (1/2 in) slices before cooking on the barbecue; use ginger cake instead of Madeira, with a splash of rum, and finish with a sprinkle of dark brown sugar instead of the almonds.  <br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For the stock, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Brown 1kg chicken drumsticks in batches, then return to the pan along with 1 roughly chopped leek, 2 roughly chopped carrots, 2 roughly chopped celery sticks, 1 halved onion, a handful of parsley, 4 thyme sprigs, 2 bay leaves and ¼ tsp black peppercorns. Cover with 1.5ltr water and bring to the boil.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Using a large metal spoon, skim the scum from the surface (repeat as needed during cooking). Push the ingredients down with the back of your spoon, submerging fully in the liquid, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hrs.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Strain the stock through a sieve into a large bowl or jug and discard the rest of the ingredients – or see our Delicious spins (below) for using up the chicken. If not using immediately, leave the stock to cool then chill for up to 2 days, or freeze for up to 3 months (see our Expert tips below).<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> To make the soup, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add 1 diced onion, 1 diced celery stick, 1 diced carrot and 200g diced swede and cook for 10 mins, or until softened. Stir in 2 finely chopped garlic cloves and the leaves of 4 thyme sprigs, then cook for 2-3 mins more.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Stir in 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp tomato purée, then add 400g tin of plum tomatoes. Cook for 5 mins before breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Add 1ltr stock and 400g tin of borlotti beans, drained. Bring to the boil, then add 50g spaghetti, broken into pieces, and cook for 5 mins.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Add the shredded leaves of ½ Savoy cabbage and continue cooking for 5 mins. Season to taste, then stir in 30g shredded basil. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and scatter over freshly grated Parmesan, extra basil leaves and a little freshly ground black pepper.<br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> The minestrone can be frozen for up to 3 months. This can even improve the flavour, though the pasta will swell a little. Allow to cool before pouring into a lidded freezer-proof container. Reheat either from frozen or defrost in the fridge overnight. Once piping hot, add toppings or garnishes and serve.<br>
